# Getting started: first-run setup and the "Getting started" card

This guide covers what happens the first time you open a fresh DentalPin installation and how the dashboard helps you finish configuring the clinic without external support.

## 1. First-run setup (`/setup`)

The first visit to a fresh installation opens the setup wizard. It takes about two minutes.

1. **Administrator account** — your name, email and a password (8+ characters with letters and numbers). This is the clinic administrator.
2. **Clinic** — clinic name, **country** and tax id. The country sets timezone, currency and VAT for you (you can still change them under *Timezone and currency*). For Spain the wizard checks the NIF/CIF format and warns if the checksum looks wrong.

Press **Create my clinic**. DentalPin creates for you:

- the treatment catalog and VAT types (Spain: exempt / 10 % / 21 %; other countries: a single exempt rate you can edit),
- an invoice series (`FAC`) and a credit-note series (`RECT`),
- one room ("Room 1"),
- a Monday–Friday schedule (Spain: 09–14 and 16–20; elsewhere 09–18).

Everything can be changed later under *Settings*.

> Use the language selector at the top of the wizard to switch the interface language at any time.

## 2. The "Getting started" card

After logging in, administrators see a **Getting started** card at the top of the dashboard with a progress bar and the steps left:

| Step | What it means | Where it takes you |
|---|---|---|
| Clinic details | Name, tax id and street address printed on budgets and invoices | *Settings → General → Clinic* |
| Rooms | At least one room so the agenda can book appointments | Inline dialog |
| Clinic hours | Your real opening hours (a fresh install may still be "open 24/7") | Inline dialog with presets |
| Your team | Add the professionals who see patients, or flag yourself as professional if you work alone | Inline dialog |
| Treatment catalog | Treatments to budget, plan and bill | *Settings → Clinical → Catalog* |
| Invoice series | Needed to issue the first invoice | *Settings → Billing → Invoice series* |
| Optional: VeriFactu (Spain), Email sending, First patient | Suggested next steps | Modules / Notifications / Patients |

- **Set up** opens the step (an inline dialog when available, otherwise the settings page).
- **Skip** (eye icon) hides a step you don't need; **Undo** brings it back.
- **Hide** removes the card for the whole clinic; steps still resolve themselves as data appears.
- The card disappears by itself once every required step is done.

Steps are checked against real data: if you delete your last room, the step reappears.

## 3. Guided mode

**Guided mode** walks you through the pending steps one page at a time. A bar under the header shows *Step N of M*, with **Next** (re-checks and jumps to the next pending step) and **Exit**. On the last step, **Finish** returns to the dashboard.

## 4. Adding colleagues without email

In *Your team* (or *Settings → People → Users*), create the user and **leave the password empty**. DentalPin shows a one-time **access link** you can **copy** or **send via WhatsApp**. Your colleague opens it, chooses a password and is signed in. The link works once and expires after seven days.

The link icon on any user row generates a new access link — useful when someone forgot their password.

> Treat the link like a password: anyone who has it can sign in to that account until it is used.
